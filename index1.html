    “My accountant said to me, ‘Well, they can never get on you for living high on the hog. It’s just not there,’” Martin says from beneath the brim of his beat-up hat.

    With his sad blue eyes and classic cowboy face, Billy Martin is an example of the small rancher trying to make a living off his land, and the problems that small rancher is having doing it. Martin, who ranches 350 head of cattle about 50 miles east of Phoenix, and thousands of others across the West are caught in the clash between the romantic myth of the Western rancher and the harsh political and economic realities of the new century.

    In 1970, there were nearly 2 million ranches in the country. In 2001, there were barely 1 million – and the trend is a downward spiral.
